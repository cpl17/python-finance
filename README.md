Repo Includes: 

* __Dow Jones__

  * _DIJ Returns_ – Compared a variety of investment strategies – momentum, contrarian, and various moving averages – to buy and hold on the closing returns for the DOW. Pricing data collected using a python api for yahoo finance, metadata gathered by scraping various wikipedia pages.

  * _Index Tracking and Forward Testing_ – Built a tracking portifolio of 10 stocks to predict the DJI. Used a SciPy implimentation of Sequential Least Squares to perform constrained optimization in order to determine the  weights. Model was tested on a test set and outperformed random weights in 67% of 10000 processes. 

* __Mutual Funds__ - Here used linear regression in both inference and predictive modeling contexts in python. For the inference modeling, I looked to explain the relationship between various portfolio indicators and financial ratios on a firms return. When building the predictive model, the focus was on predict next years returns.
